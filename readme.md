This repository contains 2 ipynb files. 

model.ipynb trains the model with augmented data as input.

data_augmentation.ipynb explains how we got all these different augmented data, their code and the accuracy along with it.

You can rerun the data augmentation file to verify the datasets or to see how the result varies when there is randomness.
